# <h1>Logistic Regression from Scratch</h1>

Simple logistic regression using NumPy to predict if a student passes based on hours studied.
labraries used are just numpy and pandas .
i did this project when i had just started learning machine learning  , exactly 'logistic regresison' , so i did it step by step from scratch to master it .
even we can do this project easily using sickit-learn but as i said it's just to master and understand how the functions and the equations work
